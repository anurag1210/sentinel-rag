1️⃣ Core Python (Non-Negotiable)

You must be dangerous here.

You should be fluent in:
	•	Async / await
	•	Generators & iterators
	•	Context managers
	•	Typing (List, Dict, TypedDict, Pydantic)
	•	Error handling patterns
	•	Packaging structure
	•	Dependency injection basics
	•	Logging best practices

Interview Expectation:

“Explain how streaming works in your FastAPI app.”

If you cannot explain generators → weak signal.

⸻

🧠 2️⃣ LLM Fundamentals (Deep Understanding)

You don’t need to train models.
But you must understand how they behave.

Topics:
	•	Tokens vs characters
	•	Context window
	•	Temperature / Top-p
	•	Prompt injection
	•	Hallucination
	•	RAG vs fine-tuning
	•	Embeddings (cosine similarity)
	•	Vector search basics
	•	Chunking strategies
	•	Re-ranking

If interviewer asks:

Why did you choose RAG instead of fine-tuning?

You must answer confidently.

⸻

🔍 3️⃣ Vector Databases & Retrieval

You used OpenSearch.
Good.

Now understand:
	•	FAISS
	•	Pinecone
	•	OpenSearch vs Elasticsearch
	•	HNSW
	•	Approximate Nearest Neighbor
	•	Indexing latency vs query latency tradeoffs
	•	Embedding dimension impact

This is very interview relevant.

⸻

🏗 4️⃣ System Design for AI Systems (CRUCIAL)

This is where you level up.

You must be able to design:
	•	Multi-tenant RAG system
	•	Chat history storage
	•	Token cost monitoring
	•	Streaming architecture
	•	Caching layer (Redis)
	•	Rate limiting
	•	Circuit breakers
	•	Observability (Prometheus, logs, tracing)
	•	Model fallback strategy

If I ask:

How would you scale this to 10,000 users?

You must think in:
	•	Horizontal scaling
	•	Stateless backend
	•	Load balancer
	•	Async workers
	•	Queue systems

⸻

🌐 5️⃣ Backend Engineering Depth

You don’t need to master Next.js.
But you must understand:
	•	REST vs SSE vs WebSockets
	•	CORS
	•	BFF pattern
	•	API gateway concept
	•	Reverse proxy (Nginx)
	•	Auth basics (JWT)

You should explain:

Why did you put a BFF layer instead of calling FastAPI directly?

That’s senior thinking.

⸻

☁️ 6️⃣ Cloud & DevOps (Huge Differentiator)

You already touched AWS.
Now deepen:
	•	IAM roles
	•	Bedrock authentication
	•	VPC basics
	•	OCU billing model
	•	Docker fundamentals
	•	ECS vs EKS
	•	Infrastructure as Code (Terraform basics)
	•	Environment variables & secrets management

This alone can double your market value.

⸻

📊 7️⃣ Production AI Concerns (Very Senior)

These separate mid from senior.
	•	Evals
	•	Guardrails
	•	Latency budgeting
	•	Cost tracking per request
	•	Prompt versioning
	•	Structured output validation
	•	Retry logic for model failures
	•	Monitoring hallucination rate
	•	Canary deployment for prompts

Most people don’t even know these exist.


Follow this:

Phase 1 (2 weeks)
	•	Async Python deep dive
	•	SSE vs WebSockets
	•	Tokenization & embeddings math

Phase 2 (2 weeks)
	•	Vector DB internals
	•	Chunking experiments
	•	Retrieval quality tuning

Phase 3 (2 weeks)
	•	AI system design
	•	Multi-user RAG architecture
	•	Add Redis caching layer

Phase 4
	•	Dockerize
	•	Add auth
	•	Add monitoring

At that point?

You are interview-ready.



Here’s What I Would Do If I Were You

Not read entire Next.js docs.

Not binge YouTube.

Not randomly grind LeetCode.

Instead:

⸻

Phase 1: Lock Down Explanation Ability (2 Weeks)

You must be able to explain what YOU built.

Not theory.

Your system.

Practice answering:
	1.	What happens when user clicks “Send”?
	2.	How does streaming work?
	3.	Why SSE and not WebSockets?
	4.	Why BFF?
	5.	Why RAG over fine-tuning?
	6.	Where is latency highest?
	7.	How would you scale to 10k users?

If you can answer these clearly, you’re already stronger than 70% of candidates.

We can simulate these interviews daily.

⸻

Phase 2: Deepen Only What Matters (Targeted, Not Random)

You don’t need to “learn Next.js”.

You need to understand:
	•	API route proxying
	•	Request lifecycle
	•	Fetch streaming
	•	TypeScript basics (types + state)

That’s it.

For FastAPI:
	•	async/await
	•	StreamingResponse
	•	Generators
	•	Dependency injection
	•	CORS middleware

That’s it.

For AWS:
	•	IAM roles
	•	Bedrock auth
	•	OpenSearch billing model
	•	VPC basics

That’s it.

No fluff.

⸻

Phase 3: Controlled Technical Question Exposure

We will:
	•	Do mock interviews
	•	Practice answering live
	•	Improve clarity
	•	Refine explanations
	•	Increase speed gradually

Not random humiliation.

Structured growth.

⸻

Very Important Truth

Interviewers don’t expect perfection.

They look for:
	•	Clear thinking
	•	Trade-off awareness
	•	Systems understanding
	•	Calm reasoning
	•	Ability to admit unknowns intelligently

You already show all of these in our discussions.

You just don’t trust yourself yet.
