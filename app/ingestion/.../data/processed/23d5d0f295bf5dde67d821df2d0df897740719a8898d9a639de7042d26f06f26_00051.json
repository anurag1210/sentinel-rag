Instead, we could choose to hit the gym, which would boost our mood with endorphins and\nhelp us feel better overall.\n“The thing about the human brain is that, when you believe something, the brain will\nscan the environment for any signs that the belief is true.”\nDr. Julie Smith\nIt's not uncommon to feel stuck and unable to make decisions when we're in a bad mood. But it's\nimportant to keep making choices, even if they're not perfect.\nTo help guide our decisions, we can think about our personal values, rather than just our\nemotions in the moment. To identify our values, we need to ask ourselves what's truly important\nto us, whether we're living in accordance with those values, and what small changes we could\nmake today to bring us closer to those goals.\nStart with one small change that you know you can implement every day. Then make a\npromise to yourself that you will follow through on it.\nConsistency is key when it comes to forming new habits. By starting small and practicing\nhealthy habits regularly, we're more likely to make better choices in the future.\nACTION: PRACTICE SELF-COMPASSION.\nRather than kicking yourself when you're down, pay attention to negative self-talk as it arises and\nthink of someone you care about. Consider how you would respond to them if they felt the same\nway you do, and then apply that same response to yourself.\n“Everyone has low days. Everyone.” Dr. Julie Smith\nMake a list of the first signs that your mood issues had resolved. What would you do differently\nand how would you live? This assists us in shifting your problem to a solution and moving\nforward.\n47\nSTRESS IS NOT OUR ENEMY, BUT A VALUABLE TOOL\nOur brains are like information processing machines, constantly analyzing our surroundings and\nmaking decisions about how to respond to different situations. But sometimes we feel\noverwhelmed or uneasy, and it's all because of cortisol - a hormone that tells our bodies to\nrelease energy to help us cope with stress.\n"}
