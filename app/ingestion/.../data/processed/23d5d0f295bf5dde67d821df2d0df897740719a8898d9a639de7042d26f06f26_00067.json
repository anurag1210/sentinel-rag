Probably not. But what if it's your friend\nwho's starting a business? Chances are, you'll give it a try.\nThis is the likability principle in action. Our innate preference for likeable people is easily\nexploitable, especially by salespeople who know how to flatter and make themselves relatable to\nus.\nBut it's not just our friends who can influence us. Our perception of someone's appearance also\nmatters. We tend to assume that good-looking people are friendly and smart, even if it's a\nflawed assumption.\nOn the other hand, the principle of authority is equally powerful. From early childhood, we look\nto authority figures for guidance and direction, often without questioning their motives. This can\nlead us to blindly follow their commands, even if we don't like them.\nHowever, it's important to remember that not all authority figures have our best interests at heart.\nBefore following their instructions, take a moment to reflect and ensure that their requests align\nwith our values and beliefs. After all, we are the masters of our own destiny.\n\"The world abounds with cults populated by dependent people who are led by a\ncharismatic figure.\"\nRobert Cialdini\nACTION: LOOK OUT FOR WILY SALESPEOPLE.\nIf you want to buy something, be aware of who is selling it to you.

What unconscious biases influence our worldviews and assumptions?\nDaniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and psychologist, unravel the mysteries of\nthe human mind as he explores the dual processes of thinking in his book \"Thinking, Fast and\nSlow\". Kahneman provides a captivating insight into decision-making, uncertainty, and\nbehavioral economics.\n\"Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it.\"\n"}
