Resisting it will only\nexacerbate the feelings and pain. We gain clarity and move closer to happiness when we let go of\ncontrol.\n“Day by day, what you think and what you do is who you become.” Heraclitus\n“One moment can change a day, one day can change a life and one life can change the\nworld.” Buddha\n9\nDON’T FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT\nDiscovering your confidence starts with being true to yourself. The Dalai Lama suggests we\nembrace our limitations and be honest about what we can and can't do.\nInstead of trying to fake it until you make it, openly admit when you're not sure about\nsomething and watch how quickly people come to your aid.\nHonesty is not just the best policy, but it also gives others an opportunity to help you and build\nyou up.\nWhen you're open and honest about your limitations, you're inviting others to come alongside\nyou and support you, building a sense of community and solidarity.\nBeing aware of your limitations and embracing them also leads to a greater sense of self-\nawareness. This means taking a deep dive into your strengths and weaknesses, so you can focus\nyour energy on what you're good at, and seek help in areas you need improvement in.\nThis self-awareness will lead you down a path of personal growth and development, helping you\nbuild confidence from the inside out.\nSo, embrace your limits, be honest about what you can and can't do, trust yourself and trust the\njourney, and watch as you become a more confident, self-assured person, ready to tackle\nwhatever challenges come your way.\nACTION: JOURNAL TO GET TO KNOW YOURSELF BETTER. \nPutting things down on paper always provides us with a sense of clarity. If you want to achieve\nhappiness, you must first understand what it means to you.\nMake a list of everything. What do you require and desire from life? How do you intend to\naccomplish it?\n\"The most important conversations you’ll ever have are the ones you’ll have with\nyourself.”\nDavid Goggins\n"}
