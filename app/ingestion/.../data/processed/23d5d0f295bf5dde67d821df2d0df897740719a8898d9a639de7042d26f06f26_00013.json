The way you\nchoose to connect with your beliefs is entirely up to you, so take a moment to reflect on what\nbeing spiritual means to you. It’s your journey, so own it!\nACTION: DISCOVER THE PRACTICES THAT MAKE YOU CLOSER TO\nHAPPINESS.\nIt's easy to become so engrossed in our daily lives that we lose sight of how brief life can be.\nCertain practices are followed by believers in every religion and spiritual belief to bring them\ncloser to true happiness.\nPracticing something, even if it's just a movement, can help you ground yourself and reach new\nlevels of consciousness. Focus on actions rather than just beliefs.\n\"Religion has been reduced to mere parroting of ideas picked up from preachers.\nNeither the preacher nor the pupil can claim to have gone through any systematic\nstudy, reflection and absorption of the truths of life.\nThe world remains as poor as ever morally and spiritually.” A. Parthasarathy\n8\nLIFE'S ONLY CONSTANT IS CHANGE\nWhen asked about suffering, The Dalai Lama cautions against the common Western\nmisconception that suffering is abnormal and something to be avoided at all costs.\nHe asserts that suffering is a natural part of life and by denying it, we only bring more pain upon\nourselves.\nThe truth is, change is the only constant in life and holding on tightly to what we know only\nleads to more suffering. So, the key is to embrace change, not resist it!\nBy accepting that life is in a constant state of flux, we can open ourselves up to the lessons and\ngrowth that come with it.\nInstead of complaining about a slammed car door or a slow cashier, we can find the silver lining\nand turn the situation around. And when faced with heartache from a breakup, we can find the\nstrength to move forward.\nEmbracing change and letting go is the path to true happiness.\nACTION: EMBRACE A STATE OF ACCEPTANCE.\nWhat we resist persists!\n"}
