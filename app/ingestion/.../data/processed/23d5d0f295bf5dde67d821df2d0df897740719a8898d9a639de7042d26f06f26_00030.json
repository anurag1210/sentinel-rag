Fill your plate with a variety of colorful fruits and\nvegetables, and take the time to savor each bite.\nDon't forget to take small exercise breaks throughout the day - set a reminder on your phone or\nchallenge your friends to a weekly step count competition. It's time to embrace a simpler,\nhealthier way of life.\n“A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought – they\nmust be earned.”\nNaval Ravikant\n26\nTHINKING TOO MUCH MIGHT PARALYZE YOU, SO JUST START MOVING\n“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage.” Dale\nCarnegie\nWho Moved My Cheese is a bestselling parable that teaches us to embrace change and thrive in\nuncertainty. It follows the story of two little people and two mice in a maze searching for cheese,\neach character representing a different attitude toward change and success.\nIn Spencer Johnson's parable, two mice named Sniff and Scurry are on a mission to find cheese\nwithin a confusing maze. They waste no time in their search and simply follow their instincts,\nwithout overthinking.\nMeanwhile, two humans named Hem and Haw also search for cheese, but they become bogged\ndown with worries about the future, second-guessing their choices, and feeling anxious about\nwhether there's any cheese left to find.\nThe lesson to be learned here is that sometimes, simplicity and taking action without excessive\nanalysis can be the key to success. Don't let fear of the unknown or analysis paralysis hold you\nback from finding your own version of \"cheese\" in life.\nEvery minute you spend wondering what success looks like, how to achieve it, whether it's even\npossible, and how you'll feel in the future is a minute you're not working towards.\nLike Sniff and Scurry, sometimes it's best to simply follow your instincts and keep moving\nforward.\nACTION: GET MOVING.\nSometimes the best strategy is to abandon strategy altogether and simply move in the general\ndirection of your goal.\nDoing something - anything - that has a chance of succeeding is preferable to simply sitting.\n"}
