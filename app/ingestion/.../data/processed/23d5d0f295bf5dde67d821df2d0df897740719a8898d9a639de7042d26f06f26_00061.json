It would be nearly impossible to drink.\nAnd consider throwing that spoonful of salt into a river. It won't make much of a difference.\nSimilarly, if our hearts are small and closed, we are easily upset by the mistakes and flaws of\nothers. However, if we open our hearts, we will discover empathy and compassion for our fellow\nhumans.\n“Understanding someone's suffering is the best gift you can give another person.\nUnderstanding is love's other name. If you don't understand, you can't love.\" Thich\nNhat Hanh\nIt's as simple as that: love requires nourishment. Happiness is the source of that\nnourishment.\nOnly when you are content can you truly open your heart and love others. Zen Buddhism teaches\nus about happiness and how to achieve it. We sometimes believe that happiness will come to us\nthrough materialistic desires. True happiness, on the other hand, is the result of mindfulness.\nWalking is a quick exercise that can help you experience happiness through mindfulness. Instead\nof focusing on the destination and rushing, consider the movement of your body and the beauty\nof your surroundings.\nWhen you practice mindfulness, you will notice beauty in the simplest of things, such as a\nflower in bloom.\nPay attention to your surroundings and your body, as well as your movement. Take everything\nin. That is how you will find true happiness. When you find happiness in the present moment,\nyou can share it with others and help them find happiness as well.\n59\nMINDFUL MEDITATION HELPS US BUILD COMPASSION FOR OURSELVES AND\nOTHERS\nMindfulness does not imply mastering difficult yoga postures or sitting silently for long periods\nof time. Meditation is not meant to be difficult, and there are numerous ways to incorporate it\ninto our daily lives.\nWe can start doing breathing exercises between stressful meetings or phone calls, or we can learn\nto walk mindfully and incorporate it into our daily commute.\nWe can live our daily life seeing everything in the light of interbeing.\n"}
