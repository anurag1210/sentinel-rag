In fact, it can be a powerful motivator that propels us\ntowards our goals. Rather than trying to eliminate stress from our lives, we should learn to\nharness it and use it to our advantage.\n\"We cannot untangle stress from a meaningful life. Whatever your unique personal\nvalues, anything that you strive towards and work for is going to require your stress\nresponse to get you there.\"\nDr. Julie Smith\nOf course, chronic stress can be harmful if we don't take care of ourselves. It's important to\nrecognize the signs of burnout, such as feeling emotionally drained or disconnected from others.\nChronic stress can also lead to physical symptoms like headaches and muscle pain, and it can\nmake us more prone to addictive behaviors like drinking alcohol.\nThe key is to find a balance between stress and rest, and to make sure we're taking care of our\nbodies and minds by replenishing the energy and nutrients we use up during stressful times. By\nlearning to manage stress and prioritize self-care, we can achieve our goals and live happier,\nhealthier lives.\nACTION: CONNECT WITH OTHERS.\nMaintaining a social life is essential for stress management, so make time to socialize with\nfriends.\n48\nHAPPINESS IS AN EMOTION, NOT A CONSTANT STATE WE CAN ACHIEVE\nWe all want to be happy. It's what we strive for and what we're told to chase. But what if we've\nbeen chasing the wrong thing all along? What if happiness isn't a permanent state but a fleeting\nemotion like all the others?\nAccording to author Russ Harris, our emotions are like the weather, always changing and\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes difficult. It's natural to experience emotions other than\nhappiness, and that doesn't necessarily mean that our lives are off track or that we have a\nmental health problem.\nDr. Julie Smith emphasizes that fixating on happiness or why we're not happier can actually\nmake us feel worse.\nInstead of chasing happiness, she suggests that we determine our personal values, which provide\na framework for decision-making and motivation during difficult times.\nValues are the principles that define who we want to be in life and how we want to live it. By\nspending time discovering our values, we can give our lives meaning and purpose beyond just\nseeking happiness.\nAnd in the end, isn't a life with purpose and meaning what we're all really looking for?\n"}
