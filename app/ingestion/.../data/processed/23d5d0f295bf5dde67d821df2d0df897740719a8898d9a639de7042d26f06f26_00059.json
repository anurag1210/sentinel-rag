When we are filled with joy, we want\nto share it with others.\nEquanimity is also referred to as inclusiveness. This trait entails the ability to blur the lines\nbetween yourself and another person so that their suffering becomes your suffering.\nCompassion enables us to see and comprehend suffering. This improves our ability to listen and\nempathize.\nLoving-kindness is the practice of using mindfulness to make others happy. This characteristic\nenables us to bring joy to even the most depressed heart.\nTrue love is not about acquiring something, but rather about being able to recognize and\ncomprehend another person's pain.\nACTION: BE GENEROUS.\nWhen you're happy, share it with others. Allow your light to shine on others so that they can be\nhappier as well.\n\"The art of happiness is also the art of suffering well.\nWhen we learn to acknowledge, embrace, and understand our suffering, we suffer\nmuch less...\nThere is no place where there is only happiness and no suffering.\" Thich Nhat Hanh\n56\nWE CAN'T CONNECT TO OTHERS IF WE ARE DISCONNECTED FROM\nOURSELVES\nDespite our many connections, many of us feel lonely and anxious. Our phones and social media\nmay seem like they help us stay in touch, but they also provide a convenient escape from\nconfronting our thoughts and feelings.\nIn today's fast-paced world, distractions are everywhere. From our demanding work schedules to\nthe constant barrage of media and technology, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle.\nThe key to connecting with others lies within ourselves. To truly understand others, we must\nfirst learn to listen to and understand ourselves.\nInstead of seeking comfort in our work, social media, or relationships, we must find peace within\nourselves.\n\"It is so important to come home to ourselves and cease being the victims of our own\ncircumstances.\" Thich Nhat Hanh\n"}
