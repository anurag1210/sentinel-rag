Consistency will help turn that habit into a routine. So,\nlet's get rolling and start building our own unstoppable momentum!\nACTION: DON'T BREAK YOUR MOMENTUM.\nYour habit must be prioritized on your to-do list.\nMissing a few sessions is all it takes to break the cycle - and render all your efforts ineffective.\n\"You will never change your life until you change the habits you do daily.\nThe secret of your success is found in your daily routine.\"\nDarren Hardy\n21\nUSE MOMENTUM TO PUSH THROUGH YOUR LIMITS, EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO\nTRICK YOURSELF AT FIRST\nWhen you're pushing towards your limits, it's important to have the power of momentum on your\nside.\nThat's why developing a good routine is so critical - it'll give you the boost you need to break\nthrough the barriers that are holding you back.\nYour good habits and decisions will start to compound and carry you forward with increasing\nforce.\nOf course, even the strongest of us will reach a limit eventually. When that happens, you can use\nthe momentum you've built up to give you an extra boost.\nJust like Arnold Schwarzenegger did when he hit his weightlifting limits. He found ways to\nactivate more muscle groups by leaning back slightly, and was able to add an extra five or six\nreps to his sets.\nThe same can be true for your weight loss journey, your running routine, or even your writing\npractice. Try changing up your approach - have water for dinner, take a less steep route for your\nrun, or write an extra page about a different topic. These \"cheats\" can help you push past your\nlimits and create even more momentum.\nACTION: LET MOMENTUM BUILD UP BEFORE YOU GIVE IT A BOOST.\nAfter you've been practicing a habit for a while, you'll need a good push to keep going.\nTo give yourself the illusion of greater progress, make your practice easier than usual.\n"}
