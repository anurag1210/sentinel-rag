Be courageous. And considerate.\"\nStephen R. Covey\nThink Win-Win\nLife is often thought of as a zero-sum game, where one person must lose for another to win. But\nwhat if we told you that working together for everyone’s benefit is more profitable in the long\nrun?\nResearch shows that cooperation instead of competition, focusing on a ‘win/win’ scenario\ninstead of a ‘win/lose,’ will increase productivity at work and improve personal relationships.\nIt’s all about finding a way for everyone to win.\nTo achieve this, effective communication is key. We often prioritize making ourselves\nunderstood instead of understanding others, but empathic listening is crucial.\nSeek First to Understand, Then Be Understood.\nAnd when it comes to forming better habits, tackling one at a time may not be enough. By\ndeveloping a habit of synergy, we can incorporate multiple good habits into our lives\nsimultaneously. This leads to positive and collaborative interactions, and healthy and\ninterdependent relationships\nACTION: LEARN TO LISTEN.\nResist the urge to offer advice right away! People are most valued when they are simply listened\nto. Give others your undivided attention and practice empathy.\n\"Listen with the intent to understand, not the intent to reply.\" Stephen R. Covey\n\"The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The\nbest way to understand people is to listen to them.\" Ralph G. Nichols\n"}
