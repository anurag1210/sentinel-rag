What will I be like when I'm seventy?\" These questions can be tough to answer,\nbut they helped Nate connect with his future self and gain perspective on his current situation.\nTo identify the future we want, there are four steps to follow:\nFirst, you need to examine the future you've unconsciously resigned yourself to. Consider what\nyour life will be like at the age of seventy. Are you happy with how things turned out? Write\nyour own biography as if you've already lived your entire life.\nNext, visualize your future self-three years from now. Imagine what your typical day looks like,\nhow your job is going, and what makes you different from who you are today.\nThen, write about these visualizations while freewriting, asking yourself questions such as \"What\nwere the major events in my life?\" and \"What were my most notable achievements?\"\nFinally, start telling your new story to others and yourself as if it were already true. This helps\nyou believe in your vision and take steps to make it a reality. Just like Nate, you too can adopt a\ngrowth mentality and transform your life.\n“Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.”\nRobin Sharma\nACTION: START FREEWRITING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.\nOnly by getting your thoughts down on paper will you begin to realize what you truly desire.\nMake time for yourself to reflect on who you are. what you stand for, and what you still want to\nachieve.\n"}
