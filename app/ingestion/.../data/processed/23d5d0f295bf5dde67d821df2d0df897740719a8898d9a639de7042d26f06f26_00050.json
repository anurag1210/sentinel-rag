Money, a byproduct of desire, holds no importance in Stoic\nphilosophy.\nThe truth, as Epictetus notes, is often far from the pursuit of wealth and success in business,\nwhere deceit and dishonesty are often rationalized.\n\"We do tell lies, while we are ready to advance the proofs that we shouldn't.\" Epictetus\nPreconceived ideas and beliefs can lead us to create a false narrative in our minds, and our\njudgement is often clouded by these incomplete stories. Lies and misinformation lead to a\nvicious cycle of confusion and it becomes difficult for us and others to determine what's true.\nWhen making decisions, only draw conclusions when you're absolutely certain of the validity of\nthe information you're using as the basis for your judgement.\nYour thoughts should be grounded in truth, without a shadow of doubt.\nACTION: CULTIVATE SILENCE.\nThe majority of daily conversations are about trivial matters. A Stoic mind prefers silence to\nmeaningless banter.\n"}
