And so should we.\" Spencer Johnson\n27\nNOTHING LASTS FOREVER, SO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR APPROACHING\nCHANGES \n“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the\nsame man.” Heraclitus\nIn \"Who Moved My Cheese,\" two mice, Sniff and Scurry, stumbled upon a massive pile of\ncheese at Station C. They didn't take it for granted and continued to search for new cheese even\nafter the stockpile began to dwindle.\nEvery day, the amount of cheese decreased slowly but steadily. When they realized they were\nabout to run out, they decided to continue on their own and soon discovered another massive\ncheese at Station N.\nOn the other hand, two humans named Hem and Haw became complacent, reveling in their\ncheese-filled comfort zone at Station C. They were so focused on the cheese that they didn't\nnotice how it was vanishing one piece at a time, and how some corners of it had even gotten\nmoldy. They were blindsided when they woke up one day to find their cheese gone.\nInstead of adapting to the new reality and seeking fresh cheese, they were overcome with fear\nand despair, returning to Station C repeatedly in the hope that their cheese would magically\nreappear.\nChange is the only constant in life, and those who embrace it and adapt will thrive.\nDon't get too comfortable with the status quo, or you might find yourself left without any cheese\nat all.\nACTION: LOOK FOR CHANGE.\nInstead of assuming that things will always remain the same, keep an eye out for new\nopportunities.\nThis allows you to adapt to change and make the most of your life.\n\"When you are afraid things are going to get worse if you don't do something, it can\nprompt you into action.\nBut it is not good when you are afraid that it keeps you from doing anything.\"  Spencer\nJohnson\n28\n"}
