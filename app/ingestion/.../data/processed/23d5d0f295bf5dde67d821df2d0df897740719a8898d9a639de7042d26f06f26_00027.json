If not, you’ll find an\nexcuse.” Jen Sincero\n22\nTHE MAIN THING IS TO KEEP THE MAIN THING THE MAIN THING\nLearn these 7 Habits of Highly Effective People for actionable steps to improve your habits and\nbecome the person you want to be. Whether it's workplace issues, family conflicts, or\nunsatisfying relationships, anyone can learn to solve and improve interpersonal problems with\nnew habits.\nThe first three habits are:\nBe Proactive,\nBegin with the End in Mind, and\nPut First Things First.\nLife has a way of shaping us, but it doesn't have to control us. While we can't control the actions\nof others, we can take responsibility for our own reactions, behaviors, and decisions. By being\nproactive and taking initiative, we can shift our patterns and see the world in a new way.\nTo be effective in work, play, or relationships, we need clear goals. By reverse-engineering the\ndesired outcome, individuals, organizations, and businesses can work proactively toward a\nmission. And by remembering that life is finite, we can focus on what really matters: our\nrelationships and legacy.\nBut distractions are everywhere, from notifications to emails. To form new habits, we need to\nlearn to prioritize and say no to trivial distractions - and even worthwhile activities that divert\nour attention from our goals. If you want to write a book, for instance, it might mean giving up\nother pursuits in the short term.\nACTION: WRITE OUT YOUR MISSION STATEMENT.\nYou can put words to your goals and better understand what to focus on by defining what you\nwant to achieve in your chosen area. Write down what's most important to you and the steps you\nneed to take to get there.\nACTION: SCHEDULE YOUR PRIORITIES IN ADVANCE.\nSet aside 30 minutes, perhaps on a Friday or Sunday, to plan out your week. Set aside specific\ntime slots for your top priorities and don't reschedule them.\n\"Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do.\n"}
