So, let's embrace enjoyment and leave pleasure behind!\nACTION: BE AWARE OF PLEASURE OVER ENJOYMENT.\nBefore you spend your money on something you truly desire. Consider whether it will provide\nyou with pleasure or enjoyment.\nIf the former, save your money for something less materialistic that will bring you genuine, long-\nlasting happiness.\n\"A joyful life is an individual creation that cannot be copied from a recipe.\"\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n12\nFLOW IS WHERE CHALLENGES AND SKILLS MATCH\nHave you ever been so absorbed in an activity that time just flies by?
