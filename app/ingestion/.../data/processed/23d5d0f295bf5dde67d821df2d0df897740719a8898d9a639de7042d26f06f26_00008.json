Recognize how it makes you feel and wait for the\npain to go away. Do not aggravate the situation by becoming angry or upset with any other\nfactors or people involved.\n\"Only we humans worry about the future, regret the past, and blame ourselves for the\npresent.\" Rick Hanson\n3\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF STOICISM ARGUES THE IDEA THAT THE ONLY PAIN\nYOU REALLY SUFFER IS THE ONE YOU CREATE YOURSELF. \nAll pain stems from resistance to things you can't change. Negative events happen all the time\nfor reasons beyond our control. We can, however, choose how we respond to them.\nPain is simply the result of your resistance to everything you are powerless to change.\nWe spend a lot of time thinking about the future and the past, but we can only live in the present\nand thus have no way of changing many things that make us unhappy.\n\"All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the\npresent.\" Eckhart Tolle\nTo fill the void, we develop a resistance to these things, which we perceive as psychological\nor physical pain.\nWhen we're angry or upset, we think and act more irrationally, which almost always\nresults in a worse situation. As a result, our reactions to things over which we have no control\ncan perpetuate the pain cycle.\nACTION: ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR PAIN IN RESISTANCE.\nWe all replay events from our past in our minds. This causes us psychological pain because\nwe resist what we can't change when all we can do is fix or move on.\nRecognize your pain and then move on.\n“When you arise in the morning, think of what a privilege it is to be alive – to breathe,\nto think, to enjoy, to love.” Marcus Aurelius\n4\nYOU CAN FREE YOURSELF FROM PAIN BY CONSTANTLY OBSERVING YOUR\nMIND AND NOT JUDGING YOUR THOUGHTS\n"}
