Extreme plans that require us to work tirelessly or sacrifice everything else in our lives are\nunlikely to last. We must find a balance that allows us to make progress while still enjoying our\nlives.\nWhen we stick to our plans, we create a compounding effect that can produce incredible results.\nJust like compound interest, the benefits of our efforts start small but grow over time.\nSo, take a step back, evaluate your plan, and ensure it’s flexible enough to accommodate the\nchanges that life inevitably brings.
