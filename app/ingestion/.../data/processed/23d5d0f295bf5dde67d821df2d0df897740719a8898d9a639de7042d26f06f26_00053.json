They are a mix of opinions, judgements, stories, memories,\ntheories, interpretations, and predictions about the future.\nAllowing all thoughts to be present, but choosing which ones we give our time and\nattention to, can have a powerful impact on our emotional experience.” Dr. Julie Smith\n49\nIDENTIFY AND REFRAME THE PROBLEMS YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH\nOur past shapes us, and childhood traumas can lead to negative habits. To move forward, we can\nlook to Louise Hay's positive philosophy, which she shares in her bestselling book You Can Heal\nYour Life. She uses her own experiences and approach to help readers change their lives through\nself-love.\nLouise Hay discovered a curious thing when she asked her clients to talk about their problems:\nthe details of the situation didn't always match the emotions behind them.\nWhile some circumstances in life are out of our control, we always have power over our\nreactions and perspectives.\nTo address the issues that trouble us, we must first look inward and examine different aspects of\nour life.\nHowever, be careful with the word 'should,' as it can carry shame and pressure, making you feel\nbad about yourself. Why do we blame ourselves for every problem in our lives? The truth is that\nour insecurities and shame blind us.\nLearning to love ourselves can be difficult, but it is essential. It's not about ignoring our flaws,\nbut about embracing gratitude and understanding our self-worth.\nMany times, we engage in self-destructive behavior, such as drug abuse or toxic relationships,\nthinking we don't deserve any better.\nBut by recognizing our value, we can start to realize that our problems don't define us as\nindividuals.\n\"I continue to explain that no matter what their problem seems to be, there is only one\nthing I ever work on with anyone, and this is Loving the Self.\" Louise Hay\nLook in the mirror and say out loud that you accept yourself exactly as you are. Sit with the\nuncomfortable feeling and repeat the words again.\n"}
