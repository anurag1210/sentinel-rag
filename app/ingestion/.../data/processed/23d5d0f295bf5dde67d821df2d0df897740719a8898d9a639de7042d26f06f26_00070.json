Examine situations\nobjectively.\nWeigh the benefits and drawbacks, then use your reasoning to make the best decision for you.\nThis is especially true when it comes to money.\n\"Changing one's mind about human nature is hard work, and changing one's mind for\nthe worse about oneself is even harder.\" Daniel Kahneman\nINSIGHT 69\nOUR TWO SYSTEMS OF THOUGHT PRODUCE TWO ENTWINED SELVES\n\"The only test of rationality is not whether a person's beliefs and preferences are\nreasonable, but whether they are internally consistent.\" Daniel Kahneman\nAccording to Daniel Kahneman, each of us is governed by two distinct 'selves'.\nThe remembering self, which is aligned with system 1, shapes and selects the memories from\nwhich the experiencing self draws.\nThe experiencing self, on the other hand, is aligned with system 2 and evaluates present and\npast information to make a decision.\nThink of it this way, the remembering self-curates the memories that shape our understanding of\nthe world, while the experiencing self-evaluates information to make informed decisions.\nBut beware, the remembering self's recollection may not always be accurate, and relying solely\non the past can lead to flawed thinking. Kahneman stresses that rational thinking demands a\nbalance of informed intuition and reason, guided by logic and evidence.\nOur intuition works to simplify our world by connecting emotions, events, and outcomes,\nwhich eventually form our identity and determine our responses. This is what Kahneman calls\nthe \"affect heuristic\", where our emotions play a big role in decision-making, making life easier\nfor our minds.\nHowever, knowing facts and statistics about human behavior does not guarantee a shift in our\nunderstanding or beliefs. As Kahneman says, \"The only test of rationality is not whether a\nperson's beliefs and preferences are reasonable, but whether they are internally\nconsistent.\"\nSo, it's up to us to question our preconceived ideas and let logic and reason guide us towards\nrational thinking.\n\"Even compelling causal statistics will not change long-held beliefs or beliefs rooted in\n"}
