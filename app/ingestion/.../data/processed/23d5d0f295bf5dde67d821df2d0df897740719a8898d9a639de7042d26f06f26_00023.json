If we make something easy, we're more likely to do it.\nFor example, if you want to learn to play the guitar, keeping it by the sofa means that you're\nmore likely to pick it up and strum a few chords.\nThe opposite is also true for bad habits. If we make something difficult or awkward to do, we're\nless likely to do it.\nThat's where the two-minute rule comes in handy. Most habits are formed at a specific moment,\nand if we can accomplish them quickly, we're more likely to stick to them. For instance, if you\nwant to go for a run every morning, laying your clothes and trainers out the night before will\nmake it easier to start.\nThe key to lasting change is to take small steps and make progress every day.\nThe law of behavior change also focuses on making new habits satisfying.\nA habit tracker can help you keep track of your progress and give you a sense of pride and\nsatisfaction. If you're writing a book, for example, jotting down your daily word count can help\nyou finish it faster.\nBut we're all wired to crave immediate rewards, and that's where the power of positive\nreinforcement comes in. Attach a positive reward to your new habit, and you're more likely\nto stick to it.\nIf you're trying to cut down on eating out, save the money you would have spent and treat\nyourself to a new jacket or a holiday. That way, you get an instant reward for sticking to your\nnew habit.\n“Each day is made up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that\ndetermine the path you take.” James Clear\n\"Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.\nYour net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits.\nYour weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits.\nYour knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.\nYour clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits.\nYou get what you repeat.\" James Clear\n19\n"}
