This is the\nscarcity principle at work.\nBusinesses use scarcity to increase sales through limited-time promotions and sales.\nIn one 1982 study, people purchased three times as much when told it was part of a limited-time\nsale as they would if there was no limit. Shoppers also purchased six times more meat when told\nthat they were the only ones who knew about the sale - the limited availability of the sale,\ncombined with the limited knowledge, drove them to buy more.\nScarcity is most powerful when availability has recently and unexpectedly decreased and there is\ncompetition for the available items. This is why people pay more at auctions when they know\nothers are bidding.\nWhen you go to buy something because it's on sale for a limited time or you're told there are only\na few left, consider whether you really want it or if you're being duped.\nWe are more likely to do things if we see others doing them, just as competition makes us\nwant something more because it is socially desirable. This is the social proof principle at work.\nWe are more likely to laugh at a bad joke if others are laughing, and we are more likely to donate\nto charity if there are coins in the bucket already.\nCompanies use this principle to promote products by saying they are 'best-sellers.\nWhen we understand the tools that people use to manipulate us, we can take a step back\nwhen we see them being used against us.\n66\nWE ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMPLY WITH AUTHORITY FIGURES AND PEOPLE\n"}
