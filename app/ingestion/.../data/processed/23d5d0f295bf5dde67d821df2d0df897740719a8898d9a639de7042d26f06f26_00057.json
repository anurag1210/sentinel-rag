Control your attention, not your emotions\nEmotions aren’t under our direct control. When you try to control things, you don’t have control\nover — like your feelings — you’ll only create more pain and suffering for yourself in the long\nrun. If you want to be more emotionally strong, validate your emotions and control your\nattention.\n“Crying does not indicate that you are weak. Since birth, it has always been a sign that\nyou are alive.” Charlotte Brontë\n2. Practice compassionate self-talk\nWhen you respond to painful emotions with negative self-talk, you train your brain to be\nashamed of feeling bad. True emotional strength comes from gentleness, not criticism.\n“Words matter. And the words that matter most are the ones you say to yourself.”\nDavid Taylor-Klaus\n3. Use values, not feelings, to make decisions\nYour emotions will lead you astray just as often as they will guide you. Listen to all your\nemotions but don’t blindly take orders from them.\n4. Set (and enforce) healthy boundaries\nEmotionally strong people know that you can’t be emotionally healthy if you never stand up for\nyourself and your own wants and needs. Just because it feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad.\n“'No' is a complete sentence.”\nAnnie Lamott\n"}
