Delete the apps\nover the weekend, or temporarily deactivate your account.\n“The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.” Marcus Aurelius\n57\nRECONNECTING WITH OUR BODIES GROUNDS US IN THE PRESENT MOMENT\nOur modern way of life contributes significantly to a disconnect between our minds and bodies.\nWe are physically present while sitting in our offices or working on our laptops, but our minds\nwander.\nWe spend so much time ruminating on the past or worrying about the future that we forget to\nappreciate the beauty of the present moment.\nThe best way to ground ourselves in the present moment is to learn how to become aware of our\nbodies through meditation.\n\"You shouldn't immerse yourself so completely in work that you get drowned in it.\nYou should have time to live, to get in touch with the refreshing and healing elements\nthat are in you and around you.\"\nPaying attention to our posture, breathing mindfully, and scanning our bodies without judgement\nfor discomfort helps to bring our minds back to where we are physically and gives us a sense of\ncalm.\n\"The best way of taking care of the future is to take care of the present, because the\nfuture is made of the present.\" Thich Nhat Hanh\nWhen we can appreciate the beauty around us, as well as all of the wonderful and complex tasks\nour bodies perform in each moment, we can begin to put our daily problems into perspective.\nWhen our minds and bodies are at ease in the present, the past and future can no longer\noverwhelm us.\nACTION: GROUND YOURSELF IN YOUR BREATH.\nClose your eyes and focus on your breathing when you're feeling overwhelmed. As you inhale\nand exhale, try counting or repeating positive mantras.\n"}
