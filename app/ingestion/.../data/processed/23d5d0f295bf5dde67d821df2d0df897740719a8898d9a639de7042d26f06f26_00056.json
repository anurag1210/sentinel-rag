Mark Twain\nrecognized this, and it's a concept that's been further developed by the 20th-century psychologist,\nAlfred Adler.\nIn Adler's view, the competitive nature of modern societies can be harmful to our mental health\nand wellbeing.\nThis is a topic that has been hotly debated in discussions on Western versus Eastern cultures.\nCountries like Japan and China are known for their emphasis on cooperation, whereas the U.S.\nand Germany tend to prioritize individualistic ideas of success.\nHowever, the problem with a narrow, competitive mindset is that it can never truly lead to\nhappiness. If you believe that you need to be the best at everything to find fulfillment -\nwhether it's making money, gaining social media likes, or having a lot of friends - you'll\nalways feel anxious and unfulfilled.\nAdler believed that the true purpose of psychology was to help individuals become courageous.\nBy letting go of a competitive mindset and embracing abundance, you'll never feel like anyone is\nholding you back.\nThere's enough success to go around for everyone, and as long as you focus on improving\nyourself, you can achieve anything.\nACTION: COOPERATE MORE WITH OTHERS.\nImagine life as a team sport. While individual achievements can be rewarding, working with\nothers and accomplishing goals together is what makes the game of life truly satisfying.\nCooperation not only helps you form deeper connections with those around you but also boosts\nyour own self-esteem. Don't let individualistic thinking limit your potential for growth and\nfulfillment.\nBe open to receiving positive feedback and constructive criticism from others. It's a key\ningredient to personal and interpersonal success. So, let go of that \"me, myself, and I\" mentality\nand embrace the power of teamwork. Together, we can achieve greatness.\n54\nTHE 4 HABITS OF EMOTIONALLY STRONG PEOPLE\nMost people hear the term emotionally strong and assume that it means the ability to ignore your\nemotions or not feel them. But that’s dead wrong…\n“Emotional strength isn’t about getting rid of difficult feelings - it means you know\nhow to respond to them in a healthy way.”\n"}
