The fear you let build up\nin your mind is worse than the situation that actually exists.\"\nSpencer Johnson\nIn Spencer Johnson's parable, the humans are stuck in their comfort zone even after running out\nof cheese.\nBut one of them, Haw, takes the brave step of venturing out to look for new cheese, and his\nsituation improves greatly once he starts moving.\nDon't let fear hold you back from progress. Once you find the courage to move on, the grip of\nfear will weaken.\nYour worries about the future may be worse than the reality of change, but standing still will\nsurely lead to disappointment.\n“By changing nothing, nothing changes.” Tony Robbins\nHaw eventually finds a new station filled with cheese, but he doesn't stop there. He keeps\nexploring and searching for new opportunities, knowing that nothing lasts forever.\nLife is full of uncertainty, but there's always more \"cheese\" out there to discover, even if we\ndon't know where or in what form it will appear.\nACTION: OVERCOME YOUR FEAR.\nIn any situation, taking the first step is the most difficult. But once you get started, everything\nwill improve. Maintain your focus and keep moving forward.\n“A ship is safe in harbor, but that’s not what ships are built for.” John A. Shedd\n29\nFIXED MINDSETS HOLD US BACK AND CAN MAKE LIFE MEDIOCRE\n\"Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.\"\nGeorge Bernard Shaw\nScience has shown that personality is not set in stone, and yet many of us hold onto the belief\nthat we're stuck with the personality we're born with. This myth keeps us from growing and\nbecoming the best versions of ourselves.\nThere are five personality myths that hinder our ability to change:\nWe can be neatly categorized into personality \"types.\"\nOur personalities are fixed and unchangeable.\n"}
