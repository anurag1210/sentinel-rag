But the good news is, change is always within reach.\nThink of your progress as a graph. The more effort you put into making a change, the steeper the\nupward trajectory. But beware, it's not a one-time solution. Devoting your entire life to a goal is\nunsustainable.\nThe key is to find a balance between your new pursuit and the rest of your life.\nAnd the secret ingredient? Habits!\n“Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going” Jim Rohn\nTransform your aspirations into a small, daily routine.\nFor instance, if healthy eating is on your mind, swap your afternoon Snickers bar with an apple.\nIf writing is your passion, start with 250 words a day. And if you're looking for love, send a\nmessage to someone new every day.\nFinding the right habit that works for you may take some trial and error, but once you do, you'll\nfind it easier to stick with your new practice. So, don't give up, keep experimenting and keep\nstriving towards your dreams.\nACTION: REPEAT UNTIL IT STICKS.\nHumans are habitual creatures. The more you do something, the more natural it will become for\nyou to do it.\nWhen beginning a new endeavor, break it down into chunks and practice at least once a day.\n“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” Lao Tzu\n16\nIT'S MUCH EASIER TO BUILD NEW HABITS WHEN YOU MAKE THEM OBVIOUS\nAND ATTRACTIVE\nLet's talk about building better habits. The first rule of thumb is to make your habits obvious,\nso that you're able to easily spot which actions are helping or hindering you.\nBy becoming aware of your daily routines, you can identify both the positive and negative habits\nthat shape your life. Making your bed each morning is an example of a positive habit, whereas\neating a chocolate bar every day when trying to lose weight is a negative one.\n"}
