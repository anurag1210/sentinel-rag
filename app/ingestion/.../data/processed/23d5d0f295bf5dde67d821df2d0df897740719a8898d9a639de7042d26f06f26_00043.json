But there's one thing that\nalways stays within our grasp - our thoughts and mentality.\nA peaceful mind is like a sturdy ship, equipped to weather any storm that comes its way.\nWith a tranquil mindset, you'll be able to tackle challenges head-on, handle success with grace,\nand make firm decisions with ease. But when your thoughts are cluttered, you'll never find the\ncalmness you seek.\nYour mind is not just your own, but it's your permanent abode. No matter where you go, if\nyour mind is troubled, you won't be able to escape the chaos.\n\"The primary indication of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one\nplace and linger in his own company.\" Seneca\nThat's where philosophy comes in. It helps us delve inward and cultivate a sound mind. Apply\nwhat you learn to your life and see the transformation for yourself. Make time for quiet\ncontemplation and never stop learning. One new thing a day keeps the anxiety away!\nACTION: BE HAPPY IN TRANQUILITY.\nBeing wealthy or well-traveled will not make you happy in the long run. Create inner peace\nand cultivate your mind so that you are always pleasant company for yourself.\n“Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes,\nand denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is\nexpectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow, and loses today. You are arranging what lies\nin Fortune's control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To\nwhat goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.”\nSeneca\n41\nKNOW WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL AND WHAT YOU CAN’T\nDo you feel trapped within the walls of your own mind, with worries, fears, and doubts taking\nover your thoughts and hindering your mental freedom? You're not alone.\nBut it's time to break free from that prison. The only thing we have complete control over is\nourselves, and it's time to take that power back. Don't let anxieties and uncertainties steer you\naway from your own liberation.\n\"Uneducated people blame other people when they are doing badly, those whose\neducation is underway blame themselves, but a fully educated person blames no one.\"\n"}
