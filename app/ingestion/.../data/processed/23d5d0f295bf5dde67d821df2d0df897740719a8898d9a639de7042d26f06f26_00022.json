However, by understanding the four components of a habit, you can develop new\nhabits that can help you achieve your goals.\nHabits are the foundation of your identity, and to change them, you must begin by asking\nyourself who you want to be.\nYour identity is shaped by repeated actions, and by improving yourself by just 1% every\nday, you can make significant changes to your life.\nJust as one paint-by-numbers does not make you an artist, one day of positive habits does not\ndefine you. However, with consistency, you can create a daily routine that will help you become\nthe person you want to be.\n\"The first mistake is never the one that ruins you.

This is one reason why meaningful change does not\nrequire radical change.\nSmall habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new\nidentity.\nAnd if a change is meaningful, it is actually big. That's the paradox of making small\nimprovements.\"\nJames Clear\n18\nIF YOU WANT NEW BEHAVIORS TO BECOME LASTING HABITS, MAKE THEM\n"}
