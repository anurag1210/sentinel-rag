He was a slave, but his wisdom was free.\nWe often feel imprisoned by our desires for things we don't have, fear of things we don't\nunderstand, and people or situations that control us.\nBut it's time to let go of those negative emotions and focus on what is truly within our power -\nourselves. True peace can be found in the humblest of circumstances when we rely on ourselves\nand don't seek the approval of others or the abundance of material possessions.\nStoicism, predating Christianity, is based on logic and the belief that \"nothing happens...\nwithout a predetermined cause.\" This means that even our successes and failures are\npredetermined, and it's crucial to understand that we have less control than we think.\nThe idea of predeterminism is not about blaming anyone for their circumstances, but about\nacknowledging that external suffering is beyond our control.

But choose wisely, as the people you surround\nyourself with can greatly impact your growth and well-being.\nFriends should inspire each other to strive for constant improvement and not just reflect each\nother's flaws.\nTrust is a crucial foundation of any relationship, but don't give it away freely.
