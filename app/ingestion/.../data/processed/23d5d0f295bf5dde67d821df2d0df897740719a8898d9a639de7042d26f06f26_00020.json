By\nchoosing a specific time and place to perform the habit, you're more likely to stick with it.\nFor instance, if you want to work out at 6 p.m. every day, you should make sure to do it in the\nsame location, creating a routine.\nBut it's not just about establishing habits - they also have to be attractive. Habits are driven by\ndopamine, which gives us the motivation to keep going. To make a habit attractive, try pairing it\nwith something you enjoy doing.\nFor example, if you love watching Netflix, but need to exercise more, try watching your favorite\nshow only when you're on the treadmill.\nBy making your habits obvious and attractive, you can create a foundation for a healthier and\nhappier life.\n“It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest\nway to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle.\nWe are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to\ntaking action.\nAs Voltaire once wrote, ‘The best is the enemy of the good.” James Clear\n17\nCHANGES THAT SEEM SMALL AND UNIMPORTANT AT FIRST WILL\nCOMPOUND INTO REMARKABLE RESULTS IF YOU'RE WILLING TO STICK\nWITH THEM FOR YEARS\nThe foundations for each habit you have follows a simple, easily managed formula:\nJames Clear, a renowned author, has taken Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charles Duhigg's\nThe Power of Habit to the next level by providing a better understanding of how habits form and\nhow to develop new ones.\nEvery habit has four essential components that contribute to its formation:\nThe first is the cue, a signal that triggers the habit. The second is the craving, a desire to fulfill\nthe habit. The third is the response, the actual habit, and the fourth is the reward, the\ngratification that results from completing the habit.\nFor instance, if you receive a notification on your phone, it serves as your cue. You then crave to\nfind out what it is, resulting in your response, where you open your phone and access the\nnotification, which is your reward. With time, this routine can become a habit, and you may find\nyourself checking your phone whenever it vibrates,"}
