If you asked 100\npeople, chances are, most of them would say regret and anxiety. But why do we worry so much?\nThe answer lies in the way our minds work. Our constant stream of thoughts is usually focused\non either the past or the future. Take oversleeping for example, we might start by regretting\nhitting the snooze button and then worry about being late for work.\nHowever, the most crucial time is the one we often neglect: the present. It's the only moment\nwhere everything happens - all our emotions and actions.\n\"Realize deeply that the present moment is all you have. Make the NOW the primary\nfocus of your life.\" Eckhart Tolle\nThe past is simply a collection of past present moments, and the future is just a bunch of present\n"}
