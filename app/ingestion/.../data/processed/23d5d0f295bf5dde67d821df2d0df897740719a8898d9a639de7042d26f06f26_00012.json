Yes, our sense of self gives us purpose in life and sets us apart\nfrom others, but running away to live in the woods is not the answer.\nInstead, we can cultivate a healthy sense of self by letting go of the things we attach our\nidentities to.\nEvery time we say “my” or “I” in regards to something, we give it power over us.
