Optimal\nexperience is thus something that we make happen.”\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n13\nHAPPINESS IS A HUMAN CONSTRUCT AND IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST\nWestern society has bought into the happiness myth - that we need to constantly chase our\ndesires to attain true joy. But in reality, this never-ending pursuit only leads to temporary\nsatisfaction and a constant craving for something more.\nThe truth is that happiness can't be bought or achieved through external means. It's an internal\nstate of being that requires hard work and dedication to a meaningful purpose.\nBuddha recognized this cycle of desire and unfulfillment long ago, and his teachings still hold\nrelevance today.\nWe don't need to become Buddhists to understand the value of his message in a world that is\nobsessed with chasing success.\nSo instead of constantly striving for more, let's shift our focus to solving problems and working\ntowards a greater purpose. When we do this, true happiness will naturally follow.\nACTION: SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAVE STACKED UP AND FIND YOUR\nNATURAL HIGH.\nDon't let procrastination get in the way of your happiness! Tackle the small problems you've\nbeen avoiding, whether it's fixing your old bike or visiting your relatives. Once you start solving\nthese little problems, you'll find that you feel a sense of accomplishment and a boost in your\nmood.\nAnd when you have free time, use it wisely!\nInstead of falling into the boredom trap of scrolling social media or binge-watching TV shows,\nfind a new hobby to explore. Whether it's cooking, drawing, or learning a new language,\nengaging in a new activity can be an incredibly fulfilling experience that brings you genuine joy.\nSo, don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new!\n“Who you are is defined by what you are willing to struggle for.” Mark Manson\n"}
