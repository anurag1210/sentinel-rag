From the invention of the printing press to the launch of the space program, great\ndiscoveries and advancements wouldn't have happened if we always demanded proof before\ntaking the leap.\nBy learning to distinguish between beliefs and facts, we open ourselves to new and exciting\ndiscoveries.\nHowever, our own intelligence sometimes hinders our ability to see the world clearly. Research\nshows that people with higher IQs are more likely to fall into the trap of thinking in stereotypes\ndue to their quick recognition of patterns.\nBut, with a bit of mental and emotional effort, we can break free from past biases and learned\nopinions, separating our identity from our beliefs.\nEmbracing new ideas in both our personal and professional lives is a surefire path to happiness\nand satisfaction, while sticking rigidly to our plans often leads to missed opportunities and\nunhappiness.\nRegular reappraisals in our relationships can also lead to more positive outcomes, allowing us to\nobjectively assess what's working and what isn't. So, let's embrace the unknown and discover\nwhat lies beyond our current perceptions.\nACTION: WORK ON YOUR RETHINKING SKILLS.\nGo looking for information that contradicts your views, test it out, and be open to change.\nACTION: FACTOR A REGULAR 'LIFE CHECKUP' INTO YOUR SCHEDULE. \nTreat your life as you do your health: examine how it's all going, and fix what's not right.\n"}
