Through his time in\nNazi concentration camps, Frankl discovered the power of logotherapy - a method that helps\nindividuals find meaning in their lives, even amidst suffering.\nFrankl's teachings, which emerged from his own traumatic experiences, have solidified his\nlegacy as a leader in modern psychology.\nAfter observing the prisoners' reactions to their traumatic experiences, Frankl made a\ngroundbreaking realization that trauma processing has three stages.\nInitially, the prisoners were in shock, but as they adjusted, they entered a period of apathy or\nemotional numbness. This was followed by a stage of disillusionment, which often happened\nafter they had survived and left the camp. Frankl observed that prisoners who refused to accept\nthe reality of their situation were the first to die, whereas those who surrendered to their fate\nfound the strength to endure.\nHe famously stated, \"Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will\nbe, what he will become in the next moment.\"\nAccepting death as a possibility allowed many detainees to survive the unimaginable horrors of\nthe concentration camps. By surrendering to the present moment and freeing their minds from\nthe fear of the future, prisoners were able to summon the apathy they needed to survive.\nEven the most basic necessities of life were taken away from prisoners, but by accepting their\nreality, they were able to endure and find moments of hope in the darkest of circumstances.\nWhether it was stealing a pair of shoes from a dead body or hiding in a pile of manure to avoid\nbeing led to the gas chambers, apathy gave prisoners the courage to face the unknown.\nFrankl's findings teach us that resistance is a complex psychological mechanism, but it often\nmakes us vulnerable to our surroundings.\nEmbrace the power of acceptance to discover a new perspective on the human experience.\n72\nFINDING THE MEANING TO YOUR LIFE IS YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY\n\"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -\nto choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"\nViktor Frankl\nWhen it comes to the game of chess, even the greatest players can't tell you what the one,\nultimate"}
