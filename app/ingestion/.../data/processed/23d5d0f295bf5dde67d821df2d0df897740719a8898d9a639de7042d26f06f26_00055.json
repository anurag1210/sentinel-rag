Instead of letting\nyour insecurities and doubts control you, take a step back and consider whether your problems\nare based in reality or just in your head.\nThis shift in perspective can help you in other areas of your life too.\nMaybe you're feeling stuck in a dead-end job that's underpaying and unfulfilling. But remember,\nit's just a stepping stone to bigger and better things.\nAnd if you're unhappy with your appearance, it's time to start appreciating all the amazing things\nyour body can do.\nIt's not uncommon for emotional turmoil to manifest as physical pain, like headaches and other\naches and pains. But by recognizing your worth and letting go of anger and negativity, you can\nstart to let go of that pain too.\nACTION: PRACTICE APPRECIATION FOR EVERYONE.\nYour forgiveness and understanding should extend to everyone, including those who have\nwronged you.\nEveryone has reasons for acting the way they do, but this is not an excuse.\nBut it was a lesson in patience.\n52\nHATING YOURSELF IS USUALLY A WAY OF REJECTING OTHERS\nOne of Kishimi's, the author of the bestselling book ‘The courage to be disliked’, students once\nrevealed a troubling self-hatred because he was too aware of his flaws, both objective and\nsubjective.\nObjective inferiorities are those that we can confirm, like lacking height or money. But\nsubjective inferiorities are self-critical beliefs, often entirely fabricated.\nIn this instance, the young man was creating reasons to hate himself to avoid being hurt by\nothers. Kishimi helped him realize that his loneliness was the root cause of his misery, not any\nactual shortcomings.\nAccording to Adler, the only flaws we should address are the objective ones, and only if they\nhinder us from achieving our goals. But subjective ones are mere illusions and we should\nexamine them before deeming ourselves unworthy.\nAn excellent remedy for this problem is to \"love yourself like your life depends on it,\" as\nKamal Ravikant puts it.\n"}
