There are two choices. First, regularly ask yourself: \"What\nwill my next thought be? Second, stop judging your thoughts and desires.\nThe first strategy is based on a physics effect known as the Quantum Zeno effect, which states\nthat by constantly observing a system, you can freeze it in its current state.\nRepeatedly asking yourself about your next thought will usually delay that thought, giving you\nenough time to realize how much time you actually spend on autopilot.

All you can do is study.\n\"Remember, you have been criticizing yourself for years and it hasn’t worked.\nTry approving of yourself and see what happens.\" Louise L. Hay\n5\nQUIT THE ETERNAL RAT RACE AND PRACTICE COMPOSURE EVERY DAY\nMost of us tend to use the concept of 'composure' incorrectly. When we say it, we expect to act\nwithout expressing our emotions.\nAssume you are a student who receives an email in the middle of class informing you that you\nhave been accepted to your top choice school.
