If you have a research paper due in\n14 days, all the time you spend regretting procrastination or worrying about the workload ahead\nwon't get you any closer to your goal.\nFocus on the present and start solving your problem right now, and you'll be on your way to\nmaking progress. Embrace the power of the present, and see how it can change your life!\n\"The more you are focused on time - past and future - the more you miss the Now, the\nmost precious thing there is.\" Eckhart Tolle\nACTION: LIVE IN THE NOW\nDwelling on the past usually results in regret, which you cannot change. Worrying about the\nfuture only adds to your anxiety about something you can't control.\nWe can only live in the present moment, so try to concentrate on that.\nWe can learn to live more fully in the world around us by staying present and understanding that\nwe are not our thoughts.\n2\nONE DART HURTS ENOUGH - BUT YOU'LL WORSEN YOUR PAIN IF YOU DWELL\nON IT\nMuch of our pain is felt on two different levels: The first level is similar to being hit by a dart: a\nsudden rush of pain. It could be the result of an accident, such as stubbing your toe, touching a\nhot plate, or crashing your bike, or it could be the result of a failed expectation, failure, or\nrejection.\nThis type of suffering is unavoidable. We all have to deal with it at some point in our lives, and\nthere isn't much we can do about it.\nHowever, most of the time, we aggravate the situation by throwing a second dart at\nourselves based on how we physically and mentally react to the first.\nAll of this adds to our suffering, except the fact that we have complete control over it. This type\nof pain is entirely optional.\nInstead, we must learn to accept the pain, do what needs to be done to heal our wounds, and\nmove on with our lives. The second darts are usually more painful than the first because we\nkeep throwing them throughout the aftermath, often long after the first dart has vanished.\nFor example, we may obsess for months over a failed relationship or worry through countless\nsleepless nights about test results.\nWhy would we throw more darts at ourselves when life already throws enough at"}
