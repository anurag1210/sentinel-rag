By prioritizing\nyourself and living in the present moment, you can experience a positive transformation in your\nlife.\nRemember that you can only alter the present, but that power to make a difference is entirely\nyours.\n“Everyone thinks of changing the world but no one thinks of changing himself.”\nLeo Tolstoy\n64\nSOCIAL PRESSURES CAN WORK AGAINST US\n\"We all fool ourselves from time to time in order to keep our thoughts and beliefs\nconsistent with what we have already done or decided\"\nRobert Cialdini\nHave you ever left a restaurant feeling a little more satisfied after being given a piece of\nchocolate for free with your bill? These gestures might seem like acts of kindness, but they’re\nactually playing by the rule of reciprocation.\nWhen someone does us a favor or gifts us something, it’s human nature to feel obligated to\nreturn the favor to avoid the guilt of not doing so. We also have a social responsibility to repay\nkindness, as those who don’t can be perceived as taking advantage of others.\nOur ancestors shared food and tools knowing that they would receive something in return.\nToday, businesses use the rule of reciprocation to their advantage, but it’s not just about\nreceiving, it’s about being seen as good and honest.\nThis is where the consistency principle comes in. When we make a commitment, we follow\nthrough, even if it puts us or our reputation in danger, because we want to align our actions with\nour words.\nHave you ever been approached by a salesperson who’s convinced you to make a small\npurchase? This is known as the ‘foot-in-the-door’ technique and it’s a sneaky way to exploit the\nprinciple of consistency.\nA small initial purchase establishes a person as a customer, making them more likely to commit\nto spending more money in the future.\n“Our best evidence of what people truly feel and believe comes less from their words\nthan from their deeds.” Robert Cialdini\nACTION: THINK BEFORE YOU RECIPROCATE.\n"}
