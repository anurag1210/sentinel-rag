But, let's face it, focusing on one task means letting go of an infinite\nnumber of other possibilities.\nInstead of striving for maximum productivity, let's embrace the art of prioritization.\nAccept that there will always be tasks left undone and choose to procrastinate on the less\nimportant ones. After all, the key to success is not to do more, but to do what truly matters.\nACTION: GET YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.\nConcentrate on only one major task at a time. Don't let completing minor tasks keep you from\nfocusing on what's truly important.\nACTION: UNDERACHIEVE, STRATEGICALLY.\nDetermine ahead of time which areas of your work and life you will no longer expect perfection\nin order to make them easier to complete.\n“Convenience culture seduces us into imagining that we might find room for\neverything important by eliminating only life’s tedious tasks.\nBut it’s a lie.\nYou have to choose a few things, sacrifice everything else, and deal with the inevitable\nsense of loss that results.” Oliver Burkeman\n34\nTIME IS A NETWORK GOOD \nWhen it comes to things like money and oil, more is always better. Quantity is the name of the\ngame and the more you have, the more valuable it becomes.\nBut, with network goods, it's a different story. The value of these goods lies in the connections\nand coordination with others.\nTake the telephone for example, the more people you have on the line, the more valuable the\ndevice becomes. And with social media, the platform is only as useful as the number of friends\nand contacts you have on it.\nHaving plenty of time is desirable, but it's not much good if you're spending it all alone.\nThe most meaningful experiences in life - spending time with loved ones, building relationships,\nstarting a business, pursuing passion projects - all require coordination and collaboration with\nothers.\nHaving lots of time but not being able to share it with others is not only a waste of time, but it\ncan also lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation.\n"}
